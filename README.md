# Internship Deep Learning Experience

Welcome to my deep learning internship repository. This repo showcases various tasks and projects that I worked on throughout my internship. Each task is linked to the respective folder, which contains the code, documentation, and results.

## Tasks

1. **[Task One: Iris Dataset Classification](https://github.com/OmarEsmat/Internship-Deep-Learning-Experience/tree/master/tasks/1-iris)**
   - **Goal:** Classifying Iris species using different machine learning models.
   - **Approach:** Implemented basic machine learning algorithms and evaluated their performance on the Iris dataset.

2. **[Task Two: Meteor Trajectory Model Refinement](https://github.com/OmarEsmat/Internship-Deep-Learning-Experience/tree/master/tasks/2-fashion%20mnist)**
   - **Goal:** Refining a meteor trajectory model by testing multiple optimization strategies.
   - **Approach:** Used various optimizers (Adam, RMSprop) with regularization, dropout, batch normalization, and early stopping to improve the modelâ€™s performance.

3. **[Task Three: Face Recognition with Transfer Learning](https://github.com/OmarEsmat/Internship-Deep-Learning-Experience/tree/master/tasks/3-face%20recognition)**
   - **Goal:** Build a face recognition model using transfer learning (VGG16 and InceptionV3).
   - **Approach:** Utilized pre-trained models (VGG16 and InceptionV3), with data preprocessing, augmentation, and fine-tuning for improved accuracy.

4. **[Task Four: Text Classification using BERT](https://github.com/OmarEsmat/Internship-Deep-Learning-Experience/tree/master/tasks/4-text%20classification%20using%20bert)**
   - **Goal:** Sentiment analysis on IMDB movie reviews using architectures like RNN, LSTM, and GRU.
   - **Approach:** Implemented different models, evaluated their performance on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, and determined the most optimal model for sentiment classification.

5. **[Task Five: Sentiment Analysis on IMDB Movie Reviews](https://github.com/OmarEsmat/Internship-Deep-Learning-Experience/tree/master/tasks/5-Sentiment%20Analysis%20on%20IMDB%20Movie%20Reviews)**
   - **Goal:** Conduct sentiment analysis on IMDB movie reviews to predict sentiments using deep learning models.
   - **Approach:** Preprocessed the dataset, tokenized reviews, and experimented with different architectures (RNN, LSTM, GRU).

6. **[Task Six: Question Answering using BERT](https://github.com/OmarEsmat/Internship-Deep-Learning-Experience/tree/master/tasks/6--Question%20Answering%20using%20bert)**
   - **Goal:** Build a question-answering system using BERT on the SQuAD dataset.
   - **Approach:** Used pre-trained BERT (`distilbert-base-cased-distilled-squad`), fine-tuned on the SQuAD dataset, and addressed challenges like tokenization and answer position mapping.
